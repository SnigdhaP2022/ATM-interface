# ATM-interface
An automated teller machine (ATM) is an electronic banking terminal that enables consumers to conduct simple transactions without the assistance of a teller or branch personnel. At most ATMs, anyone with a credit or debit card can get cash. ATMs are convenient because they allow customers to do self-service operations such as deposits, cash withdrawals, bill payments, and account transfers. Cash withdrawal fees are frequently charged by the bank where the account is held, the ATM operator, or both. Using an ATM operated directly by the bank that holds the account can prevent some or all of these costs.
